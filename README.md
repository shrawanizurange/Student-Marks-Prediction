📊 Student Score Prediction - Machine Learning Project

📝 Project Overview

This is a simple machine learning project that predicts a student’s exam score based on two features:
	•	Number of courses taken (number_courses)
	•	Time spent studying (time_study)

The goal is to apply basic data analysis and machine learning techniques to understand how these factors influence student performance.

⸻

📁 Dataset

The dataset used contains three columns:
	•	number_courses: Number of courses enrolled
	•	time_study: Hours studied per day
	•	Marks: Final exam score (target variable)

⸻

🔍 EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)
	•	Checked for null values and outliers.
	•	Visualized data using scatter plots and heatmaps.
	•	Found a strong correlation between time_study and Marks.

 🤖 Model Used

A Linear Regression model was trained to predict Marks using the independent variables:
	•	number_courses
	•	time_study
 📈 Results
	•	The model showed a strong linear relationship.
	•	Visualized predictions using a regression line.
	•	Performance metrics: R² Score, MAE, MSE.

🛠 Libraries Used
	•	pandas
	•	numpy
	•	matplotlib
	•	seaborn
	•	scikit-learn
